# Drinking Intevention Study

This study gathers information about how first year university students perceive their own drinking, and the drinking of their fellow students. From this they will receive feedback on how much they drink compared to other students, and how much they drink compared to what is considered a safe level. They will also receive encouragement to drink responsibly and information on where to find help if they need it. 
This study also optionally collects phone numbers of people who are willing to receive sms messages during orientation week. The purpose of these messages is to provide encouragement to drink responsibly. A raspberry pi sends out these messages through the web api.
